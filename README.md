# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

Mock Sprint review and retrospective for SNHU travel website project


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The Product Owner interprets user needs by interacting directly with the customer. The Product Owner then creates user stories from the perspectives of different users so that the team can get an idea of exactly what each type of user wants from the product. The team then uses these user stories to get into the mindset of the customer when developing and testing the product.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs in small iterative portions, testing along the way, rather than developing the entire program and testing at the end. In future collaborative work, I hope to incorporate the frequent communication agile encourages. I also hope to encorporate story points if possible as a measure of effort for future coding projects. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means frequent communication, collaboration, and asking questions of your team when you feel confused or stuck. When the entire team is on the same page and shares the same level of knowledge, the software development process becomes easier for everyone.
